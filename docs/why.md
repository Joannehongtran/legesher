## Okay, but why?
Its okay if you're asking yourself this question, allow me to paint you a picture.. You're familiar with a `STOP` ðŸ”´ sign right? That red hexagon with 4 white letters `S`, `T`,`O`,`P` that you see at intersections?

When one encounters that STOP sign, they are under a special pretense:  
  1. come to a complete stop  
  2. look both ways for oncoming traffic  
  3. if clear, proceed with caution to your intended direction.  
  4. if not, wait until traffic slows

**Consider this**: What if you win a mystery trip to some far off country and when you get off the plane you see a ðŸ”´ red hexagon with white letters. **BUT** the white letters aren't `S`, `T`,`O`,`P`. Instead, they're in a language _completely unfamiliar_ to you. What do you do then?

Right now in the world of software development, we're full of `STOP` signs that have the same four letters no matter where you are in the world, no matter what language you natively use. For much of the world, they see that stop sign with letters `completely unfamiliar` to them.

>**But it doesn't have to be this way..**

Language doesn't have to be a barrier. Language can be a bridge. **Legesher** creates this ability for people to learn and develop code in their own native language, without getting stuck trying to understand foreign symbols and slang. That's what we're doing here.
