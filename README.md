# Welcome to Legesher 👋

We are all about building bridges to help others better understand concepts. With **Parable**, one can learn the foundations of programming by coding in their own spoken language.

You're familiar with a STOP sign 🔴 right? That red hexagon with 4 white letters `S`, `T`,`O`,`P`? When one encounters that STOP sign, they are under a special pretense: come complete stop, look both ways for oncoming traffic, and proceed with caution in your intended direction.

What if you win a mystery trip to some far off country and when you get off the plane you see a red hexagon with white letters. BUT the white letters aren't `S`, `T`,`O`,`P`. They're in a language completely unfamiliar to you. However, because you first learned and understood the context behind the red hexagon, you're now able to apply that same understanding to the sign in front of you.

That's what we do with Parable. We allow individuals to learn _how_ to code in their native language. Because of this project, language doesn't have to be a barrier anymore.

# Contributing to Legesher 🎁
We would love for you to join in our community, because we need you! What are you gifted in? Head on over to the project's [current open issues](https://github.com/madipfaff/Legesher/issues) to see what you can get involved in!  

There are 2 main components and depending on what kind of feature you're writing, you may need to change one or more of these.

### Translator
Legesher allows for the user to code in any desired spoken language available within the `languages/*` folder. The transcompiler `legesherc` is the tool responsible for running the program in the desired spoken language. `legesherc` is written in Python and uses the `pythonparser` module to accomplish parsing.

The `legesherc` script itself lives at `tools/legesherc`.


### Legesher Platform
In order for users to take full advantage of the gift of Legesher, the platform needs to be developed. 🎉
