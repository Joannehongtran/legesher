# Welcome to Legesher üëã

>**Legesher** _(leg - ah - share)_: to bridge; to connect

### Because innovation and creativity shouldn't be lost in translation
We are all about building bridges to empower others towards the direction of their lives. With **Legesher**, our bridges allow people to code in their native language. Legesher is designed for individuals where English is a second language and for diverse teams that span across many other barriers already.

**Legesher** is a tool that enables anyone to code in their native language. In order to do that we have several projects within the **Legesher** theme to support such an mission. We built **Legesher** on top of [Atom](atom.io), a hackable text editor, in order to give users as much of a personal invitation to programming as we could.

# Developing with Legesher üíª
üë∑ Currently, Legesher is a **work in progress** / in the formation phase. We would love your help to get it up and running! Check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/madiedgar/legesher/issues) for the latest updates.

Designed for beginner developers in mind, we're starting this README.md from the very top! For more in-depth tutorials, head on over to our [wiki](https://github.com/madiedgar/legesher/wiki). If you would like more clarity on a certain topic, _submit a pull request_ or [tweet @ us üê¶](https://twitter.com/legesherio).

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download A Text Editor
> **Text Editor** - an interface that allows you to open and edit your code in an user-friendly environment

At this time, we are only actively working on extensions for the following open sourced text editors. If there is another you would like to have included on this list, please _submit a pull request_ and we'll see how all of us can make it happen!
-   [Atom](https://atom.io) <!-- insert Atom logo -->
-   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  <!-- insert VS Code logo -->


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Legesher Packages
Legesher is a collection of packages that enable you to code across language barriers. Use any one or all of them to change the way you work, hopefully allowing your innovation and creativity to flourish.

Navigate to the `Install` section in your editor's settings and search `legesher` to pull up all of our projects. <!-- TODO: Insert Install Screenshot -->

:baggage_claim: **`legesher-LANGUAGE`**
> **`legesher-LANGUAGE`** : this package allows you to code in any spoken language.

This is where our heart ‚ù§Ô∏è is. We want this list to expand, so if you know a language (or a specific dialect) that is not listed below please check the `translation` tag in the issues to join the effort. To add another language, follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/madiedgar/legesher/wiki/Add-New-Language) to add it to our project.

The current list of _supported_ dialects:
-   [Spanish (Mexico)](https://github.com/madiedgar/Legesher/tree/master/languages/spanish-mexico)
-   [French (France)](https://github.com/madiedgar/Legesher/tree/master/languages/french-france)

The current list of _work in progress_ dialects:
-   Portuguese
-   Ukrainian
-   Mandarin
-   Korean
-   Arabic

üõÑ **`legesher-ui`**
> **`legesher-ui`** : this package theme allows your editor to have the layout to go between languages.

üõÑ **`legesher-syntax`**
> **`legesher-syntax`** : this package theme allows your code to be properly vizualized.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start Coding
That's it! You're good to go and start coding. We have [several tutorials](https://github.com/WithMadi/BetaTeam) to get you on your way!

üõÑ **`legesher-docs`**
> **`legesher-docs`** : this resource allows you an inside look on the code behind the packages above as well as tutorials to best utilize these tools.

# Contributing to Legesher üéÅ
We would love for you to join in our community, because we need you! What are you gifted in? Head on over to the project's [current open issues](https://github.com/madiedgar/Legesher/issues) to see what you can get involved in!  

There are 2 main components and depending on what kind of feature you're writing, you may need to change one or more of these.

## Translator
Legesher allows for the user to code in any desired spoken language available within the `languages/*` folder. The transcompiler `legesherc` is the tool responsible for running the program in the desired spoken language. `legesherc` is written in Python and uses the `pythonparser` module to accomplish parsing.

The `legesherc` script itself lives at `tools/legesherc`.

## Legesher Platform
In order for users to take full advantage of the gift of Legesher, the platform needs to be developed. üéâ We started developing on the Atom text editor.
