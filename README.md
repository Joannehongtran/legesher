>**Legesher** _(leg - ah - share)_: to bridge; to connect

Your native language shouldn't be a barrier when you're programming software.

-------------------

We are all about building bridges to empower others towards the direction of their lives. With **Legesher**, our bridges allow people to code in their native language.

### Okay, but why?
Its okay if you're asking yourself this question, allow me to paint you a picture.. You're familiar with a `STOP` üî¥ sign right? That red hexagon with 4 white letters `S`, `T`,`O`,`P` that you see at intersections?

![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/Kibopv5xV0hHy/giphy.gif)

When one encounters that STOP sign, they are under a special pretense:  
  1. come to a complete stop  
  2. look both ways for oncoming traffic  
  3. if clear, proceed with caution to your intended direction.  
  4. if not, wait until traffic slows

**Consider this**: What if you win a mystery trip to some far off country and when you get off the plane you see a üî¥ red hexagon with white letters. **BUT** the white letters aren't `S`, `T`,`O`,`P`. Instead, they're in a language _completely unfamiliar_ to you. What do you do then?

Right now in the world of software development, we're full of `STOP` signs that have the same four letters no matter where you are in the world, no matter what language you natively use. For much of the world, they see that stop sign with letters `completely unfamiliar` to them.

>**But it doesn't have to be this way..**

Language doesn't have to be a barrier. Language can be a bridge. **Legesher** creates this ability for people to learn and develop code in their own native language, without getting stuck trying to understand foreign symbols and slang. That's what we're doing here.


# Getting Started üìç
üë∑ Currently, a **work in progress**, check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/madipfaff/legesher/issues).

**Legesher** is a tool that enables anyone to code in their native language. In order to do that we have several projects within the **Legesher** theme to support such an mission. We built **Legesher** on top of [Atom](atom.io), a hackable text editor, in order to give users as much of a personal invitation to programming as we could.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download Atom
<!-- insert Atom logo -->
Atom is available for all major operating systems. For a step-by-step instruction, check out our [wiki](https://github.com/madipfaff/legesher/wiki)!

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Packages
Navigate to the `Install` section in your editor's settings.


### Supported Languages

# Contributing to Legesher üéÅ
We would love for you to join in our community, because we need you! What are you gifted in? Head on over to the project's [current open issues](https://github.com/madipfaff/Legesher/issues) to see what you can get involved in!  

There are 2 main components and depending on what kind of feature you're writing, you may need to change one or more of these.

### Translator
Legesher allows for the user to code in any desired spoken language available within the `languages/*` folder. The transcompiler `legesherc` is the tool responsible for running the program in the desired spoken language. `legesherc` is written in Python and uses the `pythonparser` module to accomplish parsing.

The `legesherc` script itself lives at `tools/legesherc`.


### Legesher Platform
In order for users to take full advantage of the gift of Legesher, the platform needs to be developed. üéâ
