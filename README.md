# Welcome to Legesher üëã

>**Legesher** _(leg - ah - share)_: to bridge; to connect

### Your native language shouldn't be a barrier when you're programming software.
We are all about building bridges to empower others towards the direction of their lives. With **Legesher**, our bridges allow people to code in their native language.

**Legesher** is a tool that enables anyone to code in their native language. In order to do that we have several projects within the **Legesher** theme to support such an mission. We built **Legesher** on top of [Atom](atom.io), a hackable text editor, in order to give users as much of a personal invitation to programming as we could.

# Getting Started üìç
üë∑ Currently, a **work in progress**, but check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/madipfaff/legesher/issues) for the latest updates.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download Atom

**`legesher-syntax`**


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start Coding
We have [several tutorials](https://github.com/WithMadi/BetaTeam) to get you on your way!

# Contributing to Legesher üéÅ
We would love for you to join in our community, because we need you! What are you gifted in? Head on over to the project's [current open issues](https://github.com/madipfaff/Legesher/issues) to see what you can get involved in!  

There are 2 main components and depending on what kind of feature you're writing, you may need to change one or more of these.

### Translator
Legesher allows for the user to code in any desired spoken language available within the `languages/*` folder. The transcompiler `legesherc` is the tool responsible for running the program in the desired spoken language. `legesherc` is written in Python and uses the `pythonparser` module to accomplish parsing.

The `legesherc` script itself lives at `tools/legesherc`.

### Legesher Platform
In order for users to take full advantage of the gift of Legesher, the platform needs to be developed. üéâ We started developing on the Atom text editor.
