To add a new language you must do the following:

1. Add a Project of the language in the `Projects` tab, naming it the language and/or dialect.
1. Create a branch in the project for your languge, `language-LANGUAGE-DIALECT` (language-spanish-mexico)
1. Search to see if there are already open issues referring to the desired language. If not, create the following issues. 
- Add Language Core: LANGUAGE NAME
